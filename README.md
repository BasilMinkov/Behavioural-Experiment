# HSE Experiment in Cognitive Science Course Project, 2017

Here we have the code to replicate an experiment described in article **"When language gets emotional: Irony 
and the embodiment of affect in discourse"** by *R. Filik, C. M. Hunter, H.Leuthold, 2015*. Feel free to use the scripts or to report an error. 

The experiment was replicated in December, 2017 at the School of Psychology, Faculty of Social Sciences, HSE, Moscow, Russia. The experiment was conducted on a sample of Russian-speaking students. All the experimental materials and the report are in Russian. However, you can use the script with your materials in any language.
